    "The Runge Kutta method, even with larger step sizes achieves better accuracy in calculating trajectories compared to the Euler Method. The Euler method with $h = 0.01$ has significant deviations from the correct orbit over time, however the Runge Kutta method with $h = 0.5$ maintains reasonably consistent orbits over the time period measured. We can achieve the accuracy of the RK method using the Euler method by decreasing the step size to $h = 0.0001$, however this becomes significantly more computationally intensive, as we have to run iterate over a higher order of magnitude of points. It is worth nothing though that with the same step size, the Euler Method is less computationally intensive due to its simplicity. If speed is critical with accuracy less so, it may be worth using the Euler method. However,the RK method is more accurate and consistent in exchange for the extra calculations.  "

    "We consider a numerical operator such as `+, -, *, / , ^2 ` etc. as a floating point operation. First, we should see how many floating point operations are executed in the `df_dt_one_body()` function. We take the square of two 4 element vectors, then square root the sum. This gives us 10 floating point operations per call of `df_dt_one_body()`. \n",
    "Let us first consider the Euler method. Each cycle has a `+` and a `*` operation acting on 4 element vectors, and it has one call of the `df_dt_one_body()` function. This means $8 + 10 = 18$ floating point operations. \n",
    "Next, we consider the Runge Kutta method. This has multiple sub iterations for each loop, causing many more operations to be calculated. Calculating `k1` requires a call of `df_dt` (+10 operations). For `k2`, `k3` , each call `df_dt` and each have two operations on 4 element vectors, as well as a single operation acting on the scalar `h`. (+19 $\\times$ 2). `k4` has a call for `df_dt` and two operations on 4 element vectors (+18). The final line has an additional 29 operations. In total we see that there are 95 floating point operations per loop. \n",
    "Finally, let us examine the Leapfrog method. Note that for the sub iterations in the leapfrog method, we only update 2 elements of the 4 element vector for any operation. With this in mind, using a similar process used for the Runge Kutta process, we find that the leapfrog method has 24 floating point operations.\n",

    "From this analysis we can conclude that at the same time step, the Runge Kutta method is the most computationally intensive, while the Euler method is the least. We should note that the Runge Kutta method produces significantly better results the the Euler method. However, undoubtedly from an computational expense per performance perspective, the leapfrog method is superior, being only slightly more expensive than the Euler method but delivering performance closer to the Runge Kutta method.

    "Dr. Amy Chan finished her undergraduate degree in 2009 and continued to complete an Honours degree in real analysis and topology optimisation in 2010. In 2013, she became a graduate fellow with CSIRO in image analysis, to which she described her work to be “maths hand in hand with programming.” Amy stated that she had not done much statistics in her undergraduate degree, but predicted that it would be useful to her career. Amy then completed her PhD in image analysis and statistics in 2018. While studying, she realised she did not enjoy research and wanted to pursue a career in data analysis, software development, and statistics. \n",

    "After her PhD, Amy started working at Polymathian, a company that “uses a variety of techniques to provide Industrial Mathematics solutions to customers”. Such techniques include mathematical optimisation, discrete event simulation and data analytics. She has held many roles there, starting as a statistician, moving to software development and consulting, and now working in a managerial position. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to Dr. Chan, Polymathian uses a variety of tools for the mathematical techniques they implement as well as their software development and managed services. For mathematical optimisation, they use operations research, Gurobi and CPLEX in C++. Python is the main programming language they use at Polymathian, especially for their backend software development, discrete event simulation and data analytics. We are familiar with Python and have used it to program before, but have never heard of Gurobi or CPLEX. Amy also stated that they deliver websites to their customers using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Docker. These tools were unknown to us prior to the guest lecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "Amy strongly recommended applying for vacationer scholarships and internships, stating that it can help get an idea of what we might be looking for in a future job. She also mentioned that it is a good idea to try out different fields – research, academia, private sectors etc. – to help decide what career path we want/don’t want. Additionally, Amy strongly emphasised to not let a lack of domain knowledge stop us from trying since we always have the opportunity to learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "A big takeaway from the Perspective Seminar was how applicable mathematics is to the real world. It’s fascinating to find out how many fields require people skilled in mathematical literacy and programming. Overall, we really loved hearing such valuable advice from an experienced and intelligent woman in mathematics such as Dr. Amy Chan, and we feel excited about our future careers."
